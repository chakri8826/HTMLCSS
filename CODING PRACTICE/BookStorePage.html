            <p class="book-section-des">
                The 3 Mistakes of my life is the third novel written by eminent Indian
                Author Chetan Bhagat. Based on cricket, business and religion, the
                novel is set against the backdrop of beautiful city Ahmedabad.
                Revolving around three young Indian boys Omi, Ishaan and Govind, the
                book goes on to narrate how the three are trying their best to make
                ends meet in the city. Based on real events, the book starts with a
                dramatic twist, where Bhagat is reading an e-mail sent by some young
                person Govind.
